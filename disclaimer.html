      <h2>Not Financial Advice</h2>
      <p>The content and tools on <strong>NSE Stock Valuation Tool</strong> are provided for general informational and educational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, legal, tax, or other advice.

      <h2>Data and Model Limitations</h2>
      <p>Valuation outputs (intrinsic value, buy price, sell price, fair P/E, decision indicators) are produced by simplified models that use a small number of inputs and assumptions (for example, trailing EPS, forward growth estimate, chosen caps on fair PE). These models are not exhaustive and do not account for company-specific qualitative factors, macroeconomic shifts, regulatory changes, or market microstructure.</p>

      <p>We attempt to fetch live market prices from public or third-party APIs. Data availability and accuracy depend on external providers. Markets move continuously and prices may change between a displayed result and any executed trade. Verify live prices directly from your broker before acting on any recommendation.</p>
