    <div class="card">
      <h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
      <p>By accessing or using <strong>NSE Stock Valuation Tool</strong> (the “Site”), you agree to these Terms & Conditions (the “Terms”). If you do not agree, do not use the Site.</p>

      <h2>2. Service description</h2>
      <p>The Site provides tools and calculators that attempt to estimate intrinsic values and buy/sell signals based on publicly accessible market data, third-party data sources, and simplified valuation models. The Site is educational and informational in nature only.</p>

      <h2>3. No investment advice</h2>
      <p>Information on the Site is not financial advice, investment advice, trading advice or any other sort of advice and you should not treat any of the Site content as such. Use of the Site does not create a fiduciary relationship between you and the operator. Always do your own research and consult a licensed financial advisor before making investment decisions.</p>

      <h2>4. Accuracy and availability</h2>
      <p>We strive to fetch accurate data but cannot guarantee completeness, accuracy, or timeliness. Market APIs may be rate-limited or unavailable; cached or fallback values may be used. You accept that the Site may occasionally present incomplete or out-of-date information and that the operator is not liable for consequential outcomes.</p>

      <h2>5. User responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You must not use the Site for any illegal or harmful purpose.</li>
        <li>You accept that you are responsible for verifying prices and executing any trades on your own through appropriate brokerages.</li>
        <li>You agree not to attempt automated scraping, denial-of-service attacks, or other harmful actions against the Site or its data sources.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>All site design, text, scripts, and media are the property of the Site or its licensors. You may not republish or redistribute content without permission. If you use snippets for personal, non-commercial reference, credit is appreciated.</p>

      <h2>7. Links and third parties</h2>
      <p>Third-party links (advertisers, brokers, data providers) are provided for convenience. We do not endorse or control third-party sites. Their privacy, advertising, referral, and terms may differ — review them before using those services.</p>

      <h2>8. Liability limitation</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Site and its operators will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages arising from your use of the Site, including lost profits or trading losses.</p>

      <h2>9. Indemnity</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Site and its operators from any claim or demand arising from your violation of these Terms or your use of the Site.</p>

      <h2>10. Changes to these Terms</h2>
      <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. If changes are significant, we will provide notice. Continued use after changes implies acceptance.</p>

      <h2>11. Governing law</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the operator is headquartered (local law). Where local law conflicts with consumer protection regulations, those rules apply.</p>
