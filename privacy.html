    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="small">Last updated: <strong>16 November 2025</strong></p>

    <div class="card">
      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>NSE Stock Valuation Tool</strong> (“we”, “our”, “us”) collects, uses,
      shares, and protects information about visitors and users of the website. We built this site to provide
      stock valuation tools and market information. Respecting your privacy is part of providing a quality service.
      This page is written in plain language to make it actionable and auditable for both users and reviewers.</p>

      <h2>1. What information we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Automatic technical data:</strong> When you visit or interact with our site, we collect non-identifying technical data such as your IP address (anonymized where possible), browser type and version, operating system, device type, and pages visited. This helps us serve content, debug issues, and improve performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Search and interaction data:</strong> The ticker symbols or queries you enter (e.g. "RELIANCE.NS") are processed to fetch and display valuation results. This search data is stored transiently for caching and performance, not to build profiles.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-party service data:</strong> If you click external links (brokers, affiliate links), the third party may collect data separately. We are not responsible for their privacy practices — check their policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional data:</strong> If you voluntarily submit contact forms or email addresses, that data will be used only for the stated purpose (e.g., support) unless you opt in for marketing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How we use the information</h2>
      <p>We use information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Serve valuation data and search suggestions quickly (caching, rate-limits).</li>
        <li>Monitor and troubleshoot errors and performance.</li>
        <li>Improve features and user interface based on anonymous usage patterns.</li>
        <li>Provide and maintain any optional communications you request (support, notifications).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Cookies and caching</h2>
      <p>We use lightweight caching and cookies for session behavior and to reduce repeated API calls. Cookies are used for technical functionality only and do not store personal identifiers unless you provide them explicitly.</p>

      <h2>4. Third-party services</h2>
      <p>We may rely on third-party services (e.g., data providers, analytics, hosting). These providers may collect information, and their separate privacy notices apply. Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Market data providers (yfinance, NSE endpoints) — used to fetch financial data.</li>
        <li>Hosting & analytics — used to keep the site online and measure uptime/usage.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
      <p>We retain search logs and cached responses only for short, defined time windows to optimize performance and limit API requests. Personal data you submit voluntarily (e.g. via contact forms) is retained only as long as necessary to provide the service unless you request deletion.</p>

      <h2>6. Your choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> If you don’t want your browser to accept cookies, change your browser settings. Some features may be affected.</li>
        <li><strong>Data deletion:</strong> If you submitted personal data and want it removed, contact us via the email address below and we will promptly remove it from our live systems when feasible.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable steps to protect data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, and modification. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. If a breach occurs, we will follow applicable laws and notify affected parties where required.</p>

      <h2>8. Children</h2>
      <p>This site is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we discover such data was provided, we will remove it on request.</p>

      <h2>9. Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy. The effective date at the top will change and the updated page will be posted. Continued use of the site after updates constitutes acceptance.</p>

      <h2>10. Contact</h2>
      <p>For questions or requests regarding this policy, contact: <a href="mailto:contact@yourdomain.example">contact@yourdomain.example</a></p>
